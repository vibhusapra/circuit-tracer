    "We have no transcoders for gemma-2-2b-it, the instruction-tuned version of gemma-2-2b. However, [past work](https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/fmwk6qxrpW8d4jvbd/saes-usually-transfer-between-base-and-chat-models) suggests that sparse autoencoders transfer reasonably well from base to fine-tuned models. Is the same true for transcoders in the context of circuit-finding? We will apply the gemma-2-2b transcoders to gemma-2-2b, on just a couple of examples"
